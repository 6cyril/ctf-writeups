## The Remaining One (pwn 300 pts)  
### Challenge:  
Find out the only one who always stand by you, that's the key of the escape.   
```
nc chalp.hkcert21.pwnable.hk 28005  
```
(ps. This question is part 2 of "All missing")   
### Solution:  
- First of all for pyjail1, after some researches I completed with below libraries suggested by this reference (https://book.hacktricks.xyz/misc/basic-python/bypass-python-sandboxes#finding-dangerous-libraries-loaded). The final payload is below leveraging <class '_frozen_importlib._ModuleLock'>:
`().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__().pop(80).__init__.__globals__.pop('sys').modules.pop('os').system('cat flag.txt')`  
- The Remaining One is similar to a question in Plaid-CTF 2013 in a way that a While Loop is added to allow multiple inputs with additional filter (input length <= 59). See (https://github.com/osirislab/CTF-Challenges/blob/master/pctf2013/misc/pyjail/pyjail.py-ae426f39b325ed99123f590c8a8bbe224fefb406)

- Realising methods under __builtins__ is still callable after __builtins__.__dict__.clear(), we can use the update method to temporary store and concatenate our previous payload

- The final payloads after breaking into a few parts:

- Sending the same payloads to target
