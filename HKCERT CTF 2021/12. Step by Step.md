### Solution:  
As I don't have Office installation, I uploaded the excel file to Onedrive Personal and the formulas worked normally.  

The original input is "Type and check your flag!" which has a length of 25, just need to try flag format like `hkcert21{xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx}` and manually bruteforce each characters.

Flag: `hkcert21{funny_excel_rev}`
