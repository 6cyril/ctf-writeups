## Shuffle (reverse 50 pts)  
### Challenge:  
```
I heard perfect shuffle is reproducible...

Hint (Updated on 13 Nov 19:05):

- What is .pyc? Are there some tools for reverting pyc to some readable source (maybe back to python script)?
- Maybe you can use decompyle3 or uncompyle6 to convert to pyc back to python script?
- Next you have to revert the algorithm for flag, i.e. given the output, find the corresponding input (which is flag)
- Understanding random module should help a lot... What is random.seed?
- Why do this always produces same result (for same input) but not randomly differ each time? Can you make use of this to revert back to flag?
- If it generate the same "shuffling" everytime, you should be able to know how the flag shuffles, then revert the process to get the flag?

Hint: (Update on 13 Nov 22:32) random.seed will reset the randomness state when you call it, so look carefully what the original script does!

Hint: (Update on 14 Nov 4:10) Check the python version outputted by decompyle3 / uncompyle6. Python 2 and 3 are VERY different! Also try to decompose the code into different parts if you found it too hard to understand. Maybe give it some data to test?

### Solution:  
Script:
```
import random
answer = b'p\xbcl\xf0Y3C#\xf5\xf8\xb0\xe6\x98%\x17\xaf\xa8\x1d\xf1\x19\xb3i\x9aj\x1e\xccx\xb7F\xea\xfa]\r\xf1X\xc1\x8e\xee'
flag = ""

for pos in range(1,39):
    for guess in range(32,125):
        random.seed(38)
        res = list(map(int, bin(guess)[2:].rjust(8, '0')))
        for x in range(1,pos):
            random.shuffle(res)
        res = list(map(int, bin(guess)[2:].rjust(8, '0')))
        random.shuffle(res)
        if int(''.join(map(str, res)), 2) == answer[pos-1]:
             print("ans:",chr(guess))
             flag += chr(guess)
             break

print(flag)
```  
Flag: `hkcert21{s1mp13_d3shu3ff3l3_1s_s1mp13}`
