### Solution:  
- From the question description and hints I guessed this is a Volatility related forensic type question based on Linux dump. I only have experience with analysing Windows memory dump with Volatility 2 and I usually run the standalone version (an .exe file, as I don’t like to mess up my Python environment) on my Windows host machine. As a result running volatility’s imageinfo did not work as expected.
- As the hint did not mention the OS version, I tried a few official profiles from https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/profiles/tree/master/Linux/Ubuntu/x64 and that did not work on my Linux-Docker box
- Googled “volatility ubuntu 5.4.0-42 profile download” and located a useful script from the first result (https://github.com/hanasuru/vol_profile_builder). This script builds a Volatility profile for Ubuntu by providing OS and kernel versions.
- After some trial and error, found a reference on identifying profiles with a memory dump (https://heisenberk.github.io/Profile-Memory-Dump/). After that we can generate the profile using below command:
- `bash> ./build.sh 18.04 5.4.0-42-generic`

- Put the generated profiles in the right directory

- Rerun Volatility in Linux with Python 2, included profiles shows up using the --info parameter.

- Screenshot showing invalid output using an incorrect profile "LinuxUbubtu1804x64"

- Rerun command with correctly identified profile “LinuxUbuntu18_04-5-4_0-42-genericx64” generated above

- As the full path is given in the description, we just need to find the offset by command "linux_find_file"

- Extract flag.jpg with the Inode info 
- `bash> python2 vol.py --profile LinuxUbuntu18_04-5_4_0-42-genericx64 -f difficult-choice_2fdc0e16be766592692bd9c5b07c6aaa.mem linux_find_file -i 0xffff9925b63a4df8 -O flag.jpg`
